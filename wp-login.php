Haha, you've been scammed
This website doesn't use WordPress, so it's even more impossible to steal the administrative privileges of this website
The vulnerability you used is so old that there are many countermeasures to deal with you
And I have no plans to use WordPress in the future
Such crawling is meaningless and takes up my bandwidth
Bye
